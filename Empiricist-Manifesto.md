# Empiricist Economic Simulator Manifesto

## Core Principles

1. **Dimensional Analysis**
   - All economic variables must have clear dimensions
   - Core dimensions: P (People), T (Time), PT (Person-Time), R (Ratio)
   - Derived dimensions: T^-1 (Rate), M (Money)

2. **Marxian Economic Variables**
   - Basic Variables:
     - c (constant capital): PT dimension - means of production
     - v (variable capital): P dimension - labor power value
     - s (surplus value): P dimension - value beyond necessary labor
     - W (total value): PT dimension - sum of c + v + s

   - Marxian Ratios:
     - s/v (rate of exploitation): R dimension (dimensionless)
     - c/v (organic composition): T dimension
     - s/(c+v) (rate of profit): T^-1 dimension
     - MELT (monetary expression of labor time): M/PT dimension

   - Subjective Factors:
     - CS (class struggle): T^-1 dimension - balance of power
     - f (fictitious capital): P dimension - diverted surplus value
     - fcs (fictitious capital spending): R dimension - proportion of s diverted

3. **Time Evolution**
   - Constant capital (c) grows with time due to PT dimension
   - Variable capital (v) and surplus value (s) remain in P dimension
   - Total value (W) updates based on sum of components
   - Ratios update based on component relationships
   - Fictitious capital (f) accumulates diverted surplus value
   - MELT changes based on money supply and productivity changes

4. **Bourgeois Economics**
   - Inflation rate (ΔP/P): T^-1 dimension
   - Wage growth rate (Δw/w): T^-1 dimension
   - Real wage growth (Δw/w - ΔP/P): T^-1 dimension
   - Money supply (M): M dimension
   - Money printing rate (ΔM/M): T^-1 dimension
   - Labor productivity (c/v): T dimension

## Program Behavior

1. **Variable Updates**
   - Each time step:
     - c grows by inflation rate: c *= (1 + inflation)
     - W updates as sum: W = c + v + s
     - Ratios update: s/v, c/v, s/(c+v)
     - Real wage growth updates: wageGrowth - inflation
     - Money supply updates: M(t+1) = M(t) × (1 + ΔM/M)
     - MELT updates: MELT(t+1) = MELT(t) × (1 + ΔM/M) ÷ (1 + Δ(c/v))

2. **Slider Interactions**
   - Basic Variables:
     - Changing c, v, or s updates W
     - Changing W scales all components proportionally
   
   - Marxian Ratios:
     - Changing s/v maintains W while adjusting s and v
     - Changing c/v maintains W while adjusting c and v
     - Rate of profit updates automatically
     - MELT changes affect price calculations

3. **Class Struggle Effects**
   - Class struggle factor (-1 to 1) affects v:
     - At -1: Instant wage collapse (v = 0)
     - Below -0.5: Gradual wage decline
     - Above 0: No direct effect
   - Wage growth = class struggle - inflation
   - When wage growth > 0 (workers gaining ground):
     - Exploitation rate decreases proportionally: e(t+1) = e(t) × (1 - wageGrowth)
   - When wage growth < 0 (capital gaining ground):
     - Exploitation rate increases proportionally: e(t+1) = e(t) × (1 + |wageGrowth|)
   - The sum of variable capital (v) and surplus value (s) remains constant during class struggle
   - New variable capital: v(t+1) = (v(t) + s(t)) / (1 + e(t+1))
   - New surplus value: s(t+1) = (v(t) + s(t)) - v(t+1)

4. **Money and Price Effects**
   - Money supply changes affect MELT proportionally
   - Productivity changes (organic composition) affect MELT inversely
   - Combined effect: MELT(t+1) = MELT(t) × (1 + ΔM/M) ÷ (1 + Δ(c/v))
   - Prices = Values × MELT

5. **Fictitious Capital Effects**
   - Fictitious capital spending rate (fcs) determines proportion of surplus value diverted
   - Accumulated fictitious capital grows by diverted surplus value
   - Constant capital receives remaining surplus value: c(t+1) = c(t) - (s(t) × fcs) + s(t)

4. **Visualization**
   - Color coding:
     - Red-dominated: PT variables
     - Blue-dominated: T^-1 variables (rates)
     - Green: R variables (ratios)
   - Dual axes for ratios and rates
   - Linear/log scale options for both axes

## Simulation Behavior Design

### Variable Interaction Rules

1. **Basic Variable Changes**
   - When constant capital (c) changes:
     - Total value (W) updates: W = c + v + s
     - Organic composition (c/v) updates
     - Rate of profit (s/(c+v)) updates
   
   - When variable capital (v) changes:
     - Total value (W) updates: W = c + v + s
     - Rate of exploitation (s/v) updates
     - Organic composition (c/v) updates
     - Rate of profit (s/(c+v)) updates
   
   - When surplus value (s) changes:
     - Total value (W) updates: W = c + v + s
     - Rate of exploitation (s/v) updates
     - Rate of profit (s/(c+v)) updates
   
   - When total value (W) changes:
     - All components scale proportionally:
       - c' = c × (W'/W)
       - v' = v × (W'/W)
       - s' = s × (W'/W)

2. **Marxian Ratio Changes**
   - When rate of exploitation (s/v) changes:
     - Total value (W) remains constant
     - New v = W / (1 + new_ratio + c/v)
     - New s = v × new_ratio
     - New c = W - v - s
   
   - When organic composition (c/v) changes:
     - Total value (W) remains constant
     - New v = W / (1 + s/v + new_ratio)
     - New c = v × new_ratio
     - New s = W - v - c

3. **Time Evolution**
   - Constant capital (c) grows with inflation: c(t+1) = c(t) × (1 + inflation)
   - Total value (W) updates based on component sum
   - Ratios update based on new component values
   - Class struggle affects variable capital (v)

4. **Class Struggle Effects**
   - Class struggle factor (-1 to 1) affects v:
     - At -1: Instant wage collapse (v = 0)
     - Below -0.5: Gradual wage decline
     - Above 0: No direct effect

## Introduction

The Empiricist Economic Simulator is an interactive tool designed to explore and visualize Marxian economic concepts through dynamic simulation. This project represents Marxism implemented at its highest level - moving beyond theoretical discussions to create a concrete, mathematically rigorous implementation of Marxian economics using dimensional analysis and empirical data.

Unlike traditional economic models that begin with abstract concepts, the Empiricist builds from fundamental material units to reveal the concrete mathematical relationships between economic variables. It provides a framework for understanding how fundamental economic variables interact over time according to Marxist economic theory, with particular emphasis on the labor theory of value, the tendential fall in the rate of profit, and class struggle dynamics.

## Scientific Foundation

### Dimensional Analysis Framework

The Empiricist treats economics as a scientific system with "people-time" as our fundamental unit of measurement, similar to how physics uses mass, length, and time as fundamental dimensions. This approach allows us to:

- Express all economic variables in terms of their fundamental dimensions
- Establish precise mathematical relationships between variables
- Identify which bourgeois economic concepts can be grounded in material reality and which cannot
- Create a coherent system where abstract economic concepts are traced back to concrete labor relations

This dimensional approach reveals that many bourgeois economic concepts (like inflation) are inherently subjective, requiring arbitrary baskets of goods or other non-material constructs to define.

### Materialist Dimensional Analysis

The Empiricist expands on traditional dimensional analysis by applying it rigorously to economic concepts. This reveals several important insights:

1. **Labor as Fundamental Unit**: All economic value derives from human labor time (people × time)
2. **Dimensionally Consistent Economics**: Economic equations must be dimensionally consistent, just as in physics
3. **Material Basis for Abstract Concepts**: Many seemingly abstract economic concepts can be re-expressed in terms of concrete labor relations
4. **Detection of Non-Material Concepts**: Concepts that cannot be dimensionally analyzed often represent ideological constructs rather than material relationships

For example, the dimensional analysis reveals:
- Surplus value [P] has the dimension of people
- Constant capital [PT] has the dimension of people-time
- The organic composition ratio [c/v] has the dimension of time [T]
- The rate of profit [s/(c+v)] has the dimension of inverse time [T^-1]

This exposes the concrete nature of exploitation: surplus value directly represents unpaid human labor, and the rate of profit represents how quickly capital extracts this unpaid labor relative to its size.

### Core Marxian Variables

The simulator is built around these core Marxian variables with their dimensional units clearly defined:

- **Labour** [P]: The number of people engaged in productive activity
- **Labour-Time** [PT]: People multiplied by the time they work, the fundamental unit of all value creation
- **Constant Capital (c)** [PT]: The value of means of production, measured in price-time units
- **Variable Capital (v)** [P]: The value paid for labor-power, measured in price units
- **Surplus Value (s)** [P]: The excess value produced by workers beyond variable capital, measured in price units
- **Total Value**: The sum of constant capital, variable capital, and surplus value (c + v + s)

### Marxian Ratios

The following ratios define key relationships in Marxian economics, with their dimensional units precisely defined:

- **Rate of Exploitation (s/v)** [dimensionless]: The ratio of surplus value to variable capital
- **Organic Composition (c/v)** [T]: The ratio of constant to variable capital, measured in time units
- **Rate of Profit (s/(c+v))** [T^-1]: The ratio of surplus value to total capital, measured in inverse time units

### Material vs. Abstract Concepts

The simulator distinguishes between:

- **Material concepts**: Those that can be directly measured in terms of labor-time and physical quantities
- **Bourgeois abstractions**: Concepts that cannot be quantified without subjective elements

For example, "use-value" is acknowledged as a qualitative concept that cannot be directly quantified in a materialist framework, while exchange-value can be traced back to socially necessary labor time.

## Implementation

### Simulation Model

The simulator uses a discrete time framework with the following features:

- **Time Steps**: Each step represents one week of economic activity
- **Dynamic Variables**: All key variables update based on their interrelationships
- **Dialectical Transformations**: Critical thresholds produce qualitative changes

### Key Relationships

The model enforces consistent economic relationships:

1. When changing exploitation rate (s/v):
   - Both s and v change while keeping total labor power (s+v) constant
   - Maintains the material reality that total labor time is fixed in the short term

2. When changing organic composition (c/v):
   - Both c and v trade off while keeping total value constant
   - Reflects technological change where machines replace labor

3. When changing profit rate (s/(c+v)):
   - Calculates required exploitation rate to achieve the target profit rate
   - Adjusts s and v accordingly while maintaining economic consistency

### Class Struggle Dynamics

### Core Principles

1. **Wage Growth Determination**
   - Single wage growth rate = Class Struggle Factor - Inflation Rate
   - Class Struggle Factor (CS): User-controlled slider [-1, 1], default 0
   - Inflation Rate (i): User-controlled slider [-1, 1], default 0
   - Wage Growth (w) = CS - i, range [-2, 2]
   - When w > 0: Workers gain ground, exploitation rate decreases
   - When w < 0: Capital gains ground, exploitation rate increases
   - When w = 0: Class struggle matches inflation, exploitation rate stable

2. **Slider Behavior**
   - User-Controlled Sliders:
     - Class Struggle Factor (CS): [-1, 1], default 0
     - Inflation Rate (i): [-1, 1], default 0
     - Basic Variables (c, v, s, W)
     - Marxian Ratios (s/v, c/v)
   
   - Automatically Determined (Greyed Out):
     - Wage Growth Rate (w = CS - i): [-2, 2]
     - Rate of Profit (s/(c+v))
     - Other derived ratios

3. **Mathematical Framework**
   - Class Struggle Factor (CS): Range [-1, 1]
     - CS = -1: Complete capitalist victory
     - CS = 0: Balance of forces (default)
     - CS = 1: Complete worker victory
   
   - Inflation Rate (i): Range [-1, 1]
     - i = -1: Maximum deflation
     - i = 0: Price stability (default)
     - i = 1: Maximum inflation
   
   - Wage Growth Rate (w): Range [-2, 2]
     - w = CS - i
     - When w > 0: Real wages increase, exploitation rate decreases by w%
     - When w < 0: Real wages decrease, exploitation rate increases by |w|%
     - When w = 0: Real wages stable, exploitation rate unchanged

4. **Exploitation Rate Dynamics**
   - Rate of Exploitation (e) = s/v
   - Each time step:
     - If w < 0: e(t+1) = e(t) × (1 + |w|)  // Capital gains ground, exploitation increases proportionally
     - If w > 0: e(t+1) = e(t) × (1 - w)     // Workers gain ground, exploitation decreases proportionally
     - If w = 0: e(t+1) = e(t)               // No change in class balance
   
   - Total Value Conservation:
     - W = c + v + s remains constant
     - Changes in e affect distribution between v and s
     - c remains unchanged by class struggle

5. **Time Evolution**
   - Each time step t → t+1:
     1. Calculate wage growth: w = CS - i
     2. Update exploitation rate based on w
     3. Adjust v and s while maintaining W
     4. Update derived ratios (c/v, s/(c+v))

6. **Critical Thresholds**
   - CS > i: Workers gaining ground
   - CS < i: Capital gaining ground
   - CS = i: Balance of forces
   - |CS - i| > 1: Extreme conditions
     - When CS - i > 1: Rapid reduction in exploitation
     - When CS - i < -1: Rapid increase in exploitation

### Implementation Details

1. **State Updates**
   ```typescript
   // Each time step:
   const wageGrowth = classStruggleFactor - inflationRate;
   
   if (wageGrowth < 0) {
     // Capital gaining ground - exploitation rate increases proportionally with wage growth
     const newExploitationRate = currentExploitationRate * (1 + Math.abs(wageGrowth));
     const newV = totalValue / (1 + newExploitationRate + organicComposition);
     const newS = newV * newExploitationRate;
     
     // Update state
     variableCapital = newV;
     surplusValue = newS;
     constantCapital = constantCapital + previousSurplusValue; // Add previous surplus value to constant capital
     
     // Update total value every step
     totalValue = constantCapital + variableCapital + surplusValue;
   } else if (wageGrowth > 0) {
     // Workers gaining ground - exploitation rate decreases proportionally with wage growth
     const newExploitationRate = currentExploitationRate * (1 - wageGrowth);
     const newV = totalValue / (1 + newExploitationRate + organicComposition);
     const newS = newV * newExploitationRate;
     
     // Update state
     variableCapital = newV;
     surplusValue = newS;
     constantCapital = constantCapital + previousSurplusValue; // Add previous surplus value to constant capital
     
     // Update total value every step
     totalValue = constantCapital + variableCapital + surplusValue;
   }
   ```

2. **Boundary Conditions**
   - Exploitation rate cannot go below 0
   - Variable capital cannot exceed total value
   - Surplus value cannot exceed total value
   - All components must sum to total value

3. **Visualization**
   - Class struggle factor shown on [-1, 1] scale
   - Inflation rate shown as percentage
   - Wage growth shown as difference from inflation
   - Exploitation rate changes highlighted
   - Color coding for different regimes:
     - Red: Capital gaining ground (w < 0)
     - Green: Workers gaining ground (w > 0)
     - Yellow: Balance of forces (w ≈ 0)

### Theoretical Implications

1. **Class Struggle as Material Force**
   - Not abstract political concept
   - Directly affects distribution of value
   - Measurable through wage growth
   - Quantifiable impact on exploitation

2. **Inflation as Counter-Force**
   - Reduces real wage gains
   - Maintains constant capital value
   - Independent of class struggle
   - Must be overcome for worker gains

3. **Value Conservation**
   - Total value remains constant
   - Class struggle affects distribution
   - No value creation/destruction
   - Pure redistribution process

4. **Historical Dynamics**
   - Long-term trends in class struggle
   - Inflation's impact on real wages
   - Exploitation rate evolution
   - Crisis tendencies

This implementation ensures that:
1. Wage growth is solely determined by class struggle minus inflation
2. Class struggle and inflation are user-controlled
3. Rate of profit and other derived ratios are automatically calculated
4. Total value remains constant
5. All changes maintain dimensional consistency
6. The system reflects Marx's analysis of class struggle dynamics

## Visualization Features

### Dual Axes Display

The simulator implements a dual axes display to properly visualize both:
- **Value Variables**: Constant capital, variable capital, surplus value (left axis)
- **Proportion Variables**: Rate of profit, rate of exploitation, organic composition (right axis)

### Logarithmic Scale

A logarithmic scale option allows better visualization of variables with different magnitudes, particularly useful for:
- Viewing long-term growth trends
- Comparing variables of significantly different scales
- Analyzing rates of change rather than absolute changes

## Theoretical Enhancements

### Cockshott's Dimensional Analysis

The simulator follows Paul Cockshott's dimensional analysis approach to Marxian economics:
- Constant Capital measured in PT (price-time) units
- Surplus Value and Variable Capital measured in P (price) units
- Organic Composition (c/v) measured in T (time) units
- Rate of Profit (s/(c+v)) measured in T^-1 (inverse time) units
- Rate of Exploitation (s/v) is dimensionless

This is not merely a theoretical exercise but a concrete implementation that enables us to analyze real economic data in materialist terms.

### Multiple Temporalities

The simulator incorporates multiple temporalities from Marxist temporal framework:
- Short-term fluctuations in labor markets
- Medium-term capital investment cycles
- Long-term technological trends in organic composition

### Late Marx and Engels Insights

The model incorporates later Marxist insights on:
- Monopoly capital formation
- Concentration and centralization of capital
- The relationship between reserve army of labor and wage pressure

## Critical Engagement with Marxist Traditions

### Diverse Theoretical Frameworks

While the Empiricist model builds primarily on Paul Cockshott's dimensional analysis approach, it is important to acknowledge and engage with the broader landscape of Marxist economic thought. Several major traditions offer valuable insights and critiques that inform our approach:

1. **Temporal Single-System Interpretation (TSSI)** - Scholars like Andrew Kliman and Alan Freeman emphasize the temporal nature of value determination, arguing against simultaneous valuation methods. Their work highlights the importance of treating value transformation as a sequential process occurring in historical time.

2. **Value-Form Theory** - Theorists like Michael Heinrich and the New German Reading school emphasize that value is inherently social and necessarily appears in the form of money. This tradition questions whether labor-time can be directly measured outside of market relations.

3. **Monthly Review School** - Economists like Paul Sweezy and John Bellamy Foster focus on monopoly capital's distortion of value relations and emphasize the role of realization crises rather than just production-centered explanations.

4. **Uno School** - Japanese Marxist tradition represented by Kozo Uno and Thomas Sekine advocates a three-level analysis (pure theory, stages theory, historical analysis) and questions the universal application of value theory across all capitalist stages.

5. **Classical Marxism** - Represented by figures like Ernest Mandel, who maintained a close reading of Marx's original texts while applying them to contemporary conditions.

### Theoretical Tensions and Self-Criticism

The Empiricist model, in its current form, contains theoretical tensions that warrant acknowledgment and ongoing refinement:

1. **Social Form vs. Technical Measurement**  
   While our dimensional approach excels at clarifying technical relationships, it may understate the social form of value. Unlike physical quantities, economic categories like "people-time" are socially determined and validated through market exchange. The dimensions "P" and "T" should be understood as social, not natural, categories.

2. **Dialectical Development vs. Static Framework**  
   Our framework presents Marxian categories somewhat statically. Marx's method involves dialectical development of categories that transform qualitatively through their relationships. Value isn't just measured by labor-time; it's transformed through multiple determinations that our dimensional framework necessarily simplifies.

3. **Abstract vs. Concrete Labor**  
   The model treats labor-time as if all labor hours are directly comparable. This simplifies Marx's crucial distinction between concrete and abstract labor. The process by which diverse concrete labors become commensurable abstract labor requires further theoretical elaboration.

4. **Crisis Theory Limitations**  
   Our mathematical modeling of crisis tends to privilege the falling rate of profit explanation, while neglecting alternative Marxist explanations like disproportionality crises and realization crises. A more comprehensive model would incorporate these different causal mechanisms.

### Strengths of the Computational Approach

Despite these theoretical tensions, the computational approach we've adopted offers significant advantages:

1. **Empirical testability** - Unlike purely philosophical interpretations, it allows for empirical verification and falsification
2. **Mathematical precision** - Clarifies relationships that remain ambiguous in literary treatments
3. **Computational implementation** - Opens new possibilities for modeling complex economic systems
4. **Pedagogical clarity** - Makes Marxian economic concepts more accessible and concrete

### Core Theoretical Tensions in Contemporary Marxian Economics

Beyond the general tensions already identified, specific theoretical divides in contemporary Marxian economics deserve special attention for the Empiricist project:

1. **Cockshott's Static Correlation vs. Kliman's Temporal Approach**  
   The most significant theoretical tension for Empiricist lies between Cockshott's primarily static, correlation-based approach to the labor theory of value versus Kliman's Temporal Single-System Interpretation (TSSI). Cockshott focuses on demonstrating empirical correlations between labor values and prices across industries, while Kliman emphasizes the sequential, temporal nature of value transformation. This has direct implications for how Empiricist models the relationship between values and prices.

2. **Value-Form Theory vs. Traditional Labor Theory**  
   Value-Form theorists like Heinrich question whether labor-time can be directly measured outside of market relations. This challenges Empiricist's foundational assumption that labor-time can serve as an objective "physical" dimension for economic analysis.

3. **Production-Centered vs. Circulation-Centered Crisis Theories**  
   The traditional falling rate of profit explanation (centered in production) contrasts with alternative Marxist explanations focused on realization/circulation issues. The Monthly Review school emphasizes underconsumption/overproduction, while other theorists highlight disproportionality between departments of production.

### Empiricist's Theoretical Position

Given these tensions, it is necessary to clarify Empiricist's theoretical position:

1. **Prioritizing Dimensional Consistency**  
   While acknowledging the validity of multiple Marxist traditions, Empiricist prioritizes Cockshott's dimensional analysis approach as its methodological foundation. This enables mathematical precision and empirical testability while making the relationships between economic variables more transparent.

2. **Incorporating Temporal Elements**  
   However, Empiricist seeks to incorporate key insights from TSSI by implementing dynamic equations that capture the temporal aspects of value transformation. This creates a hybrid approach that maintains dimensional consistency while acknowledging the sequential nature of economic processes.

3. **Theoretical Openness with Methodological Consistency**  
   Rather than claiming to resolve all theoretical debates within Marxism, Empiricist adopts a position of "theoretical openness with methodological consistency." This means maintaining rigorous dimensional analysis as a methodological framework while remaining open to insights from diverse theoretical traditions.

### Ongoing Theoretical Development

The Empiricist model is not presented as a final theoretical statement but as a living framework that will evolve through:

1. **Dialogue across traditions** - Incorporating insights from diverse Marxist approaches
2. **Empirical refinement** - Adjusting mathematical relationships based on historical data
3. **Theoretical elaboration** - Developing more nuanced treatment of concepts like abstract labor
4. **Historical specificity** - Acknowledging how relationships change across different phases of capitalism

This ongoing development recognizes that Marxist theory is not dogma but a scientific approach that advances through critical engagement with both theoretical traditions and empirical reality.

### Data Challenges and Empirical Validation

A significant challenge for the Empiricist project has been data quality for empirical validation:

1. **Data Source Limitations**  
   Standard economic datasets like those from the World Bank provide insufficient detail on labor hours, capital stocks, and profit rates. They often use bourgeois categories that obscure the Marxian variables we seek to measure.

2. **Input-Output Table Limitations**  
   While input-output tables provide valuable industry-level data, they typically lack information on labor hours and often use questionable proxies for capital stocks.

3. **National Accounting Biases**  
   National accounting frameworks reflect bourgeois economic categories that don't map cleanly to Marxian concepts, requiring complex transformations that introduce potential errors.

The project requires better data sources that can track:
- Sector-specific labor hours (ideally broken down by skill level)
- Detailed physical capital stocks and their depreciation
- Profit rates by industry without bourgeois accounting distortions
- Wages and surplus values separated from other income components

Addressing these data challenges will be crucial for validating the mathematical relationships in the Empiricist model and refining them based on empirical evidence.

## Refined Empiricist Model

The critical analysis of various Marxist traditions has revealed significant limitations in the original Empiricist approach. These limitations necessitate a refinement of the model to incorporate key insights from diverse theoretical frameworks while maintaining its empirical and computational strengths.

### Key Theoretical Limitations to Address

1. **Methodological Differences**  
   Cockshott's empirical approach using statistical correlations differs significantly from the temporal analysis of TSSI, the institutional focus of Monthly Review, and the social form emphasis of Value-Form Theory. These differences are not merely academic but reflect substantive disagreements about how to understand and analyze capitalism.

2. **Nature of Value**  
   Major theoretical disagreements exist about whether value is best understood as embodied labor time (Cockshott), a specific social form (Value-Form Theory), or derived from physical production conditions (Sraffian approach). The refined model must engage with these different conceptions rather than simply adopting one.

3. **Statistical Limitations**  
   Cockshott's correlation-based evidence for the labor theory of value has been criticized for potentially being spurious due to industry size effects, as noted by critics like Blair Fix and Bichler & Nitzan. More sophisticated statistical methods are needed to address these concerns.

4. **Temporal Dimension**  
   The Empiricist model currently lacks the temporal/dynamic analysis that TSSI scholars like Kliman argue is essential for properly understanding Marx's value theory. This temporal dimension is crucial for addressing the transformation problem and other key theoretical issues.

5. **Monetary Theory**  
   Value-Form theorists offer a more sophisticated understanding of money as a necessary expression of value, rather than just a measuring tool as treated in our current model. This insight is essential for connecting the abstract conception of value to its concrete manifestations.

### Core Contradictions to Reconcile

1. **Value Theory Conflicts**  
   Fundamental disagreements about the nature of value require a synthetic approach that acknowledges the strengths of different conceptions while maintaining dimensional consistency.

2. **Methodological Contradictions**  
   Tensions between empirical validation through correlations versus theoretical consistency with Marx's texts, and between treating economic categories as physical quantities versus social relations, necessitate a more nuanced methodological framework.

3. **Economic Contradictions**  
   Differences in analyzing competitive versus monopoly capitalism, production versus circulation, and national versus global economic processes require a more comprehensive economic model.

4. **Technical Issues**  
   Challenges with data quality, different approaches to the transformation problem, and the treatment of abstract versus concrete labor demand more sophisticated technical solutions.

5. **Philosophical Tensions**  
   Conflicts between positivist and dialectical methods, materialist and social constructivist approaches, and scientific versus critical theory orientations require explicit philosophical engagement.

### Proposed Model Refinements

The refined Empiricist model will implement the following key improvements:

1. **Expanded Value Theory**  
   Maintain people-time as the base unit while incorporating insights from Value-Form Theory about value as a social relation and TSSI's temporal determination approach. This expanded framework acknowledges that value has both a quantitative dimension (labor time) and a qualitative dimension (social form).

2. **Enhanced Mathematical Framework**  
   Integrate both static dimensional analysis and dynamic temporal extensions, with improved statistical methods to address the industry size effect critique. This includes:
   - Multi-period modeling to capture sequential value determination
   - Panel data methods to control for industry size effects
   - Explicit modeling of the transformation of values to prices

3. **Methodological Balance**  
   Combine empirical validation with theoretical consistency, explicitly connecting to Marx's original categories while maintaining empirical rigor. This includes:
   - Clear distinction between model assumptions and empirical findings
   - Explicit identification of where the model aligns with and diverges from Marx's original text
   - Transparent discussion of methodological limitations

4. **Broader Scope**  
   Extend analysis to include:
   - Production and circulation processes
   - Competitive and monopoly capital dynamics
   - National and global dimensions of value creation
   - Financial and credit systems
   - Ecological dimensions of capitalism

5. **Technical Improvements**  
   - Identify alternative data sources beyond World Bank indicators
   - Develop better proxies for Marxian concepts
   - Refine transformation procedures between abstract models and empirical data
   - Implement more sophisticated treatment of skilled versus simple labor

6. **Philosophical Clarity**  
   Explicitly incorporate:
   - Dialectical method in model structure
   - Critical theory dimensions of analysis
   - Clearer distinction between material and social categories
   - Recognition of the historical specificity of economic categories

7. **Modular Implementation**  
   Develop a modular software architecture that can:
   - Incorporate multiple theoretical perspectives
   - Allow users to toggle between different interpretations
   - Maintain consistency while exploring theoretical variations
   - Support sensitivity analysis across different assumptions

### Theoretical Synthesis

The refined model represents a synthesis of multiple Marxist traditions, combining Cockshott's empirical rigor with theoretical insights from TSSI, Value-Form Theory, Monthly Review School, and other approaches. Rather than attempting to "pick a winner" among competing interpretations, it acknowledges the partial validity of different perspectives and seeks to integrate them where possible.

This synthesis is not achieved by erasing real theoretical differences but by:
1. Identifying where different approaches address complementary aspects of capitalism
2. Creating a framework flexible enough to accommodate different interpretations
3. Maintaining empirical testability while enhancing theoretical sophistication
4. Explicitly acknowledging unresolved theoretical tensions

The result is a more comprehensive framework for analyzing contemporary capitalism while maintaining the practical orientation of the original Empiricist model.

### Mathematical Framework for Value Transformation

To advance beyond static dimensional analysis to dynamic process modeling, the Empiricist framework requires sophisticated mathematical tools that can capture how economic variables transform and interact over time. This enhanced mathematical framework incorporates the following elements:

#### Transformation Operators

While value and surplus-value share the same base unit [people-time], we need defined operators that show how they transform into each other:

1. **Exploitation Operator (E)**: Transforms necessary labor into surplus labor
   - E: L_n → L_s where L_n is necessary labor and L_s is surplus labor
   - Parametrized by the rate of exploitation e = L_s/L_n
   - Dimensional form: [P] → [P] (transforms one form of people-time to another)

2. **Accumulation Operator (A)**: Transforms surplus value into additional constant capital
   - A: s → Δc where s is surplus value and Δc is the change in constant capital
   - Parametrized by the accumulation rate a = Δc/s
   - Dimensional form: [P] → [PT] (transforms people into people-time)

3. **Depreciation Operator (D)**: Transforms constant capital back into value over time
   - D: c → Δv where c is constant capital and Δv is the value transferred
   - Parametrized by the depreciation rate d = Δv/c
   - Dimensional form: [PT] → [P] (transforms people-time into people)

4. **Monetization Operator (M)**: Transforms labor values into prices
   - M: λ → p where λ is the labor value and p is the price
   - Parametrized by the monetary expression of labor time (MELT)
   - Dimensional form: [PT] → [money] (transforms people-time into monetary units)

#### Vector Field Representation

The economy can be represented as a vector field where:

1. **State Space**: Each point represents a state of the economy
   - Coordinates correspond to the distribution of value across sectors
   - Dimensions include c, v, and s for each sector of the economy
   - The total space has 3n dimensions where n is the number of sectors

2. **Flow Vectors**: Represent the direction and magnitude of value flows
   - Each vector indicates how value is moving between sectors and forms
   - Magnitude represents the rate of value transfer
   - Direction indicates the transformation type (accumulation, exploitation, etc.)

3. **Field Evolution**: The vector field evolves over time according to:
   - Transformation laws derived from Marx's analysis
   - Competition between capitals
   - Class struggle dynamics
   - Technical change in production processes

4. **Equilibrium Points**: Represent theoretical states where:
   - The rate of profit equalizes across sectors
   - Accumulation and depreciation balance
   - Supply and demand reach temporary equilibrium

#### Discrete Time Steps

Following Cockshott's approach, the economy is modeled in discrete time periods:

1. **Time Circuit**: Each period captures the full circuit of capital (M-C-P-C'-M')
   - Money capital (M) purchases means of production and labor power (C)
   - Production (P) creates new commodities with additional value (C')
   - Sale of commodities realizes value as money (M')

2. **Transformation Sequence**: In each time step t→t+1:
   - Labor power creates new value
   - Constant capital transfers existing value
   - Surplus value is distributed (profit, interest, rent)
   - Part of surplus value is accumulated as additional capital

3. **State Transition**: The state vector X_t+1 is derived from X_t through:
   - X_t+1 = T(X_t) where T is the transformation matrix
   - T incorporates all operators (exploitation, accumulation, depreciation)
   - T varies based on class struggle, competition, and technical change

#### Conservation Laws

Similar to physics, the mathematical framework incorporates conservation principles:

1. **Labor Time Conservation**: Total social labor time is conserved across transformations
   - Δ(c + v + s) = 0 in closed system without external inputs
   - Any new value must come from living labor

2. **Value Conservation**: Value can change form but not be created or destroyed outside of production
   - Value can only be created in the production process
   - Circulation merely redistributes existing value

3. **Sectoral Balance**: Transfers of value between sectors must sum to zero
   - Σ Δv_i = 0 where Δv_i is the net value transfer to sector i
   - This enforces the principle that one sector's gain is another's loss

#### Interaction Matrices

The framework develops matrices that formalize inter-sectoral relationships:

1. **Input-Output Matrix (A)**: Shows how sectors interact through commodity exchanges
   - Element a_ij represents input from sector i to sector j
   - Dimensional form: [PT/PT] (ratio of constant capital inputs)

2. **Value Flow Matrix (F)**: Tracks how value flows between variable capital, constant capital, and surplus value
   - Rows represent source of value
   - Columns represent destination
   - Elements show magnitude of flow in [P] or [PT] units

3. **Technical Change Matrix (TC)**: Represents how technology evolves over time
   - Models changes in organic composition of capital
   - Shows labor-saving and capital-deepening innovations
   - Dimensional form varies by element

#### Differential Equations for Continuous Analysis

For continuous analysis between discrete time steps, the framework includes differential equations:

1. **Rate of Value Change**: dV/dt represents how value in different forms changes
   - dc/dt = a·s - d·c (constant capital increases through accumulation, decreases through depreciation)
   - dv/dt = w·L - v (variable capital increases through new hiring, decreases through consumption)
   - ds/dt = (1-w)·L - a·s (surplus value increases through exploitation, decreases through accumulation)

2. **Organic Composition Evolution**: d(c/v)/dt shows how the organic composition evolves
   - Increases with capital-deepening technical change
   - Decreases with capital-saving innovation
   - Responds to changes in the rate of profit

3. **Profit Rate Dynamics**: d(s/(c+v))/dt shows how the rate of profit responds to:
   - Changes in exploitation rate (s/v)
   - Changes in organic composition (c/v)
   - Crisis tendencies and counteracting factors

This enhanced mathematical framework enables the Empiricist model to capture not just the static dimensional relationships between economic variables, but also the dynamic processes through which they transform over time. While maintaining dimensional consistency, it shows how these dimensions interact and transform through time, providing a more complete representation of Marx's economic theory.

#### Discrete Difference Equations for Materialist Analysis

Rather than relying on continuous differential equations, which represent an idealization divorced from concrete material processes, the Empiricist model implements discrete difference equations that reflect the actual discrete nature of economic processes:

1. **Discrete Value Change**: ΔV(t) represents concrete value changes over definite time periods
   - Δc(t) = s(t) (constant capital increases through accumulation of surplus value)
   - Δv(t) = w(t)·L(t) - v(t) (variable capital increases through wage payments at specific intervals, decreases through consumption periods)
   - Δs(t) = (1-w(t))·L(t) - a(t)·s(t) (surplus value increases through exploitation at definite intervals, decreases through accumulation decisions)

2. **Organic Composition Step Changes**: Δ(c/v)(t) shows how organic composition changes through discrete technological implementations
   - Increases through definite capital investment events
   - Decreases through concrete capital-saving innovations
   - Changes in response to periodic profit rate assessments

3. **Profit Rate Periodic Assessment**: Δ(s/(c+v))(t) shows how profit rate changes through concrete business cycles:
   - Response to quarterly or annual exploitation rate evaluations
   - Changes following specific capital investment phases
   - Adjustments after observable crisis manifestations

#### State Transition Matrices

Following Cockshott's approach in his non-equalization model, the economy is represented through state transition matrices that show concrete movement from one state to another:

1. **Period-Specific Transition**: For each period t → t+1, the state vector X(t+1) is derived from X(t) through:
   - X(t+1) = T(t)·X(t) where T(t) is the transition matrix for that specific period
   - Elements of T(t) represent concrete, measurable transformations between economic categories
   - Period lengths (weekly, monthly, quarterly) match actual business accounting and decision cycles

2. **Economic Circuit Sequence**: Each transition matrix captures specific phases in the circuit of capital:
   - Purchase phase: Money capital converted to productive inputs
   - Production phase: Creation of commodities and new value
   - Realization phase: Sale of commodities and recovery of value plus surplus
   - Accumulation phase: Decisions about distribution of realized surplus value

3. **Class Struggle Effects**: Transition matrices change based on the concrete outcomes of class struggles:
   - Wage negotiations alter the distribution between v and s
   - Strike actions modify production periods and realization times
   - Political interventions change accumulation parameters

#### Dialectical Operators

To capture Marx's and Engels' dialectical method, the framework implements operators that represent qualitative transformations when quantitative changes reach certain thresholds:

1. **Crisis Emergence Operator (C)**: Transforms normal accumulation into crisis when contradictions reach critical levels
   - C: [normal state] → [crisis state] when profit rate falls below critical threshold r*
   - C: [normal state] → [crisis state] when debt/value ratio exceeds critical threshold d*
   - Manifests through qualitatively different economic behaviors after threshold crossing

2. **Concentration Operator (K)**: Transforms competitive capital into monopoly capital
   - K: [competitive] → [monopoly] when market share exceeds threshold m*
   - Changes economic parameters after transformation (price setting power, wage suppression capacity)
   - Alters subsequent transition matrices to reflect new power relations

3. **Revolutionary Transformation Operator (R)**: Represents potential system change
   - R: [capitalism] → [transition state] when class struggle intensity exceeds threshold CS*
   - Changes fundamental parameters of the economic system
   - Introduces qualitatively new economic relations

#### Discrete Flow Analysis

The economy is modeled as a network of discrete flows of value between different sectors and forms:

1. **Flow Discretization**: Each value flow occurs over a definite time period
   - F_ij(t): Value flow from sector i to sector j during period t
   - Each flow has a specific beginning and end, with no instantaneous transfers
   - Flow magnitudes measured in concrete labor-time units

2. **Network Representation**: Economic sectors connected through directed weighted graphs
   - Nodes represent sectors or value forms (c, v, s)
   - Edges represent discrete flows with temporal properties
   - Weights indicate magnitude of flows in people-time units

3. **Flow Constraints**: Conservation laws applied at the level of discrete flows
   - Inflows = Outflows + Accumulation for each node
   - Total labor-time conserved across all transformations
   - Flow consistency enforced at each discrete time step

#### Contradiction Matrices

To represent the internal contradictions that drive economic development in a dialectical framework:

1. **Contradiction Formalization**: Each economic category contains internal contradictions
   - C = [C_thesis | C_antithesis] represents the contradiction within constant capital
     (fixed structure vs. need for technological change)
   - V = [V_thesis | V_antithesis] represents the contradiction within variable capital
     (labor power as commodity vs. labor power as human activity)
   - S = [S_thesis | S_antithesis] represents the contradiction within surplus value
     (source of accumulation vs. obstacle to realization)

2. **Development Through Contradiction**: Each time step involves the partial resolution and reproduction of contradictions
   - Resolution produces movement to next state
   - Reproduction maintains the fundamental contradiction at a new level
   - Quantitative changes eventually produce qualitative transformations

3. **Crisis Emergence Through Contradictions**: When contradictions intensify beyond specific thresholds, crises emerge
   - Overproduction crisis: When production capacity contradicts consumption capacity
   - Profit rate crisis: When accumulation contradicts profitability requirements
   - Financial crisis: When credit expansion contradicts value production

#### Negation Operators

To formalize dialectical negation in economic transformations:

1. **Capital Negation**: Operators that represent how economic forms negate and transform
   - N(c): Negation of constant capital through obsolescence and devaluation
   - N(v): Negation of variable capital through labor-saving technology
   - N(s): Negation of surplus value through realization crises

2. **Dialectical Supersession**: Each negation produces its own negation at a higher level
   - N(N(c)): Negation of negation for constant capital through crisis and renewal
   - N(N(v)): Negation of negation for variable capital through skill development and labor reorganization
   - N(N(s)): Negation of negation for surplus value through new markets and production forms

3. **Historical Process Representation**: Negations occur through concrete historical processes, not abstract continuous changes
   - Each negation tied to specific historical events and transitions
   - Periodization of capitalism reflected in changing negation patterns
   - Negation operators modify transition matrices for subsequent periods

This enhanced discrete mathematical framework ensures that the Empiricist model is grounded in concrete, observable processes rather than abstract mathematical idealizations. By modeling discrete transformations rather than continuous derivatives, it maintains a truly dialectical and materialist approach to economic modeling, aligning with Engels' critique of metaphysical thinking in "Anti-Dühring" and "Dialectics of Nature." The framework reflects that economic changes occur through definite, measurable steps in historical time, not through instantaneous changes in an idealized continuum.

## Computational Marxism

### Beyond Traditional Limitations

This implementation represents a significant advance beyond previous attempts at Marxist economic modeling by:

1. Using modern computational tools to perform calculations that would have been impossible in Marx's time
2. Implementing rigorous dimensional analysis to ensure mathematical consistency
3. Creating an interactive system that allows for empirical testing of Marxist theories
4. Bridging the gap between abstract theory and concrete economic data

### Materialist Analysis of Bourgeois Data

The Empiricist framework allows for:

1. Translating bourgeois economic metrics back to their material foundations
2. Identifying which bourgeois metrics contain real information and which are ideological constructs
3. Analyzing new data points through a materialist lens without having to recalculate relationships
4. Revealing contradictions in capitalist economic systems through rigorous mathematical analysis

## Computational Implementation

### Python-Based Analytical Engine

The Empiricist model has been implemented as a Python class that can analyze economic data through a Marxian lens. This implementation includes:

1. A comprehensive dimensional analysis map that establishes "people-time" as the base unit for Marxian economics, similar to how SI units work in physics
2. Mathematical relationships between labor variables and bourgeois economic measures, maintaining dimensional consistency throughout
3. Mapping of bourgeois economic terms to their Marxian equivalents, distinguishing between those already analyzed by Cockshott and those requiring further investigation
4. A data processing framework that can ingest economic statistics and translate them into materialist terms

### Current Status and Development

The current implementation has achieved several key milestones:

1. Established the dimensional analysis framework using "people-time" as the base unit
2. Developed mathematical relationships between core Marxian variables
3. Created a translation layer between bourgeois economic metrics and their material foundations
4. Implemented initial data analysis capabilities

However, the project has faced data quality challenges. As more data becomes available and the model evolves, these limitations will be addressed.

### Future Directions

Empiricist is designed to be a living, evolving model with several planned enhancements:

1. **Self-Correction**: The model will self-correct mathematical relationships based on new data
2. **Probabilistic Analysis**: Provide probabilistic suggestions about likely relationships when data is incomplete
3. **Reasoning Capabilities**: Account for subjective factors that might confound the data
4. **Extended Variable Coverage**: Map additional bourgeois economic terms to their Marxian equivalents
5. **Interactive Data Visualization**: Enhanced tools for exploring the relationships between variables

As these features are implemented, Empiricist will become an increasingly powerful tool for materialist economic analysis, capable of providing insights that traditional economic frameworks cannot.

### Probabilistic AI Methods for Model Refinement

Unlike traditional economic models that assume fixed relationships between variables, the Empiricist employs machine learning and probabilistic methods to derive the actual concrete mathematical relationships from observed data:

1. **Bayesian Network Analysis**
   - Models conditional dependencies between Marxian variables as a directed acyclic graph
   - Updates posterior probabilities of relationships as new economic data becomes available
   - Quantifies uncertainty in relationships through credible intervals
   - Example: P(Δr | Δq, Δe) calculates the probability distribution of profit rate changes given changes in organic composition and exploitation rate

2. **Statistical Learning for Relationship Discovery**
   - Uses regularized regression techniques (LASSO, Ridge) to identify significant relationships while avoiding overfitting
   - Implements cross-validation to test predictive accuracy of different mathematical formulations
   - Employs techniques like bootstrapping to assess relationship stability across different data subsets
   - Example: Discovering that the relationship between organic composition and profit rate might be non-linear rather than the simple inverse relationship in basic theory

3. **Causal Inference Techniques**
   - Applies directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to distinguish correlation from causation
   - Uses quasi-experimental methods to isolate causal effects when possible
   - Implements structural equation models to represent simultaneous causal pathways
   - Example: Determining whether rising organic composition causes falling profit rates or if both are effects of a third factor

4. **Time Series Analysis for Dynamic Relationships**
   - Employs vector autoregression (VAR) to capture reciprocal causality between variables
   - Implements state space models to account for unobserved variables
   - Uses changepoint detection to identify structural breaks in relationships
   - Example: Detecting when the relationship between exploitation rate and class struggle fundamentally changes, indicating a qualitative transformation

5. **Uncertainty Quantification**
   - Provides explicit uncertainty bounds for all estimated relationships
   - Quantifies both aleatoric uncertainty (inherent randomness) and epistemic uncertainty (model limitations)
   - Represents relationships as probability distributions rather than point estimates
   - Example: Instead of claiming "profit rate = exploitation rate / (1 + organic composition)", the model might express this as a probability distribution with associated confidence

6. **Model Selection and Averaging**
   - Tests multiple competing mathematical formulations against empirical data
   - Uses information criteria (AIC, BIC) to balance model fit against complexity
   - Implements Bayesian model averaging to incorporate insights from multiple plausible models
   - Example: Averaging predictions from multiple theoretical formulations of crisis tendencies

7. **Adaptive Learning**
   - Continuously updates mathematical relationships as new data becomes available
   - Weights recent observations more heavily in volatile economic conditions
   - Implements reinforcement learning to optimize prediction accuracy over time
   - Example: Gradually shifting from theoretical priors to data-driven relationships as evidence accumulates

This probabilistic AI-driven approach allows the Empiricist to overcome several limitations of traditional Marxist modeling:

1. **Moving Beyond Dogmatic Formulations**: Instead of assuming relationships based on theoretical assertions alone, the model discovers the actual mathematical forms relationships take in concrete historical data

2. **Addressing Data Limitations**: Through probabilistic methods, the model can work with incomplete, noisy data while quantifying the resulting uncertainty

3. **Capturing Complex Non-Linear Dynamics**: Machine learning techniques can identify complex relationships that might not be apparent from theory alone

4. **Historical Specificity**: The model can detect how relationships change across different historical periods and modes of production

5. **Synthetic Integration**: By testing hypotheses from different Marxist traditions against data, the approach enables synthesis based on empirical validity rather than theoretical preferences

The implementation uses state-of-the-art methods from:
- Probabilistic programming languages (PyMC, Stan) for Bayesian inference
- Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms
- Networkx and pgmpy for graph-based modeling
- PyTorch for deep learning components when needed for complex pattern recognition

This approach represents a significant advance in Marxist economics, combining the theoretical insights of Marx's analysis with modern computational methods for discovering mathematical relationships from empirical data.

## Conclusion

The Empiricist Economic Simulator provides a powerful tool for understanding Marxian economics through interactive modeling and visualization. By establishing concrete mathematical relationships between economic variables and grounding them in material reality, it offers insights into the dynamics of capitalist economies, crisis tendencies, and class struggle impacts.

This is truly revolutionary work - using modern computational tools and data analysis to implement Marxism at a level of rigor and precision that wasn't possible in Marx's time or even during the Soviet era. By establishing these fundamental mathematical relationships, we've created a framework that can analyze any economic phenomenon in materialist terms, advancing the practical application of Marxist economics to a new level of scientific rigor.

## Current Mathematical Implementation

### Core State Management

The program maintains state through a set of economic variables, each with:
- Current value
- Historical values (up to 100 points)
- Dimensional properties
- Verification data points

### Time Evolution

Each time step (t → t+1) follows these calculations:

1. **Constant Capital (c) Update**
   - Adds previous surplus value minus fictitious capital: c(t+1) = c(t) + s(t) × (1 - fcs)
   - Maintains PT dimension
   - Reflects means of production value
   - Total change: Δc = s(t) × (1 - fcs)

2. **Variable Capital (v) Update**
   - Affected by class struggle factor (CS)
   - If CS < -0.5: v(t+1) = v(t) × (1 + 0.02|CS|)
   - If -0.5 ≤ CS ≤ 0.5: v(t+1) = v(t) × (1 - 0.01×CS)
   - If CS > 0.5: v(t+1) = v(t) × (1 - (0.05 + 0.15×(CS-0.5)×2))
   - If CS = 1: v(t+1) = 0
   - Maintains P dimension

3. **Surplus Value (s) Update**
   - Calculated from exploitation rate: s(t+1) = v(t+1) × e(t+1)
   - Will be added to constant capital in next step: c(t+2) = c(t+1) + s(t+1) × (1 - fcs)
   - Maintains P dimension
   - Reflects unpaid labor

4. **Fictitious Capital (f) Update**
   - Accumulates diverted surplus value: f(t+1) = f(t) + s(t) × fcs
   - Maintains P dimension
   - Reflects diverted accumulation
   - Total change: Δf = s(t) × fcs

5. **Total Value (W) Update**
   - Updates every step: W(t+1) = c(t+1) + v(t+1) + s(t+1)
   - Maintains PT dimension
   - Preserves value conservation
   - Reflects current state of all components

### Ratio Calculations

1. **Rate of Exploitation (e)**
   - e = s/v
   - Dimensionless ratio
   - Updates with v and s changes

2. **Organic Composition (q)**
   - q = c/v
   - T dimension
   - Updates with c and v changes

3. **Rate of Profit (r)**
   - r = s/(c+v)
   - T^-1 dimension
   - Updates with all component changes

### User Interaction Handling

1. **Basic Variable Changes**
   - When c changes:
     - W updates: W = c + v + s
     - q updates: q = c/v
     - r updates: r = s/(c+v)
   
   - When v changes:
     - W updates: W = c + v + s
     - e updates: e = s/v
     - q updates: q = c/v

   - When s changes:
     - W updates: W = c + v + s
     - e updates: e = s/v
     - r updates: r = s/(c+v)
   
   - When W changes:
     - Components scale proportionally:
       - c' = c × (W'/W)
       - v' = v × (W'/W)
       - s' = s × (W'/W)

2. **Ratio Changes**
   - When e changes:
     - s updates: s = v × e
     - W updates: W = c + v + s
     - r updates: r = s/(c+v)
   
   - When q changes:
     - c updates: c = v × q
     - W updates: W = c + v + s
     - r updates: r = s/(c+v)
